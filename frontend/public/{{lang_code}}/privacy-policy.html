<h4>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;What information do we collect?</h4>
<h5>1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Personal information you disclose to us</h5>
<p>
<strong>In Short:</strong> We collect personal information that you provide to us.
<span>We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us when you register on the App, express an interest in obtaining information about us or our products and Services, when you participate in activities on the App or otherwise when you contact us.</span>
</p>
<p>The personal information that we collect depends on the context of your interactions with us and the App, the choices you make and the products and features you use. The personal information we collect may include the following:</p>
<p><strong>Personal Information Provided by You:</strong>&nbsp;We collect email addresses; phone numbers; names; and other similar information.</p>
<p><strong>Social Media Login Data:</strong> We may provide you with the option to register with us using your existing social media account details, like your Facebook, Twitter or other social media account. If you choose to register in this way, we will collect the information described in the section called ""HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS?" below.</p>
<p>All personal information that you provide to us must be true, complete and accurate, and you must notify us of any changes to such personal information.</p>
<h5 class="mt-4">1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Information automatically collected</h5>

This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of our App, and for our internal analytics and reporting purposes.</span>
</p>
<p>Like many businesses, we also collect information through cookies and similar technologies.</p>

<li><strong>Device Data:</strong>&nbsp;We collect device data such as information about your computer, phone, tablet or other device you use to access the App. Depending on the device used, this device data may include information such as your IP address (or proxy server), device and application identification numbers, location, browser type, hardware model Internet service provider and/or mobile carrier, operating system and system configuration information.</li>
<li><strong>Location Data:</strong>&nbsp;We collect location data such as information about your device's location, which can be either precise or imprecise. How much information we collect depends on the type and settings of the device you use to access the App. For example, we may use GPS and other technologies to collect geolocation data that tells us your current location (based on your IP address). You can opt out of allowing us to collect this information either by refusing access to the information or by disabling your Location setting on your device. Note however, if you choose to opt out, you may not be able to use certain aspects of the Services.</li>
</ul>
<h5 class="mt-4">1.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Information collected through our App</h5>

<ul class="my-4">
<li><strong>Geolocation Information:</strong>&nbsp;We may request access or permission to and track location-based information from your mobile device, either continuously or while you are using our App, to provide certain location-based services.

<li><strong>Mobile Device Access:</strong>&nbsp;We may request access or permission to certain features from your mobile device, including your mobile device's microphone, storage, sms messages, social media accounts, camera, and other features.

We will however take all necessary measures to protect your personal information in accordance with this privacy notice and applicable law.</p>
<h5>7.1&nbsp;&nbsp;European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses:</h5>

<p>We have implemented appropriate technical and organisational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorised third parties will not be able to defeat our security, and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information.
