          <h4 className="mt-36">12&nbsp;&nbsp;Concluding provisions</h4>
          <p>
            12.1&nbsp;&nbsp; Legal disputes arising from this Contract are
            governed exclusively by Austrian law. Application of the UN Convention
            for the International Sale of Goods, the referral standards of the
            IPRG and the Regulation (EC) no. 593/2008 of the European Parliament
            and of the Council of June 17, 2008 on the law applicable to
            contractual obligations (Rome I Regulation) is excluded.
          </p>
          <p>
            12.2&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive jurisdiction for disputes arising out of
            or in connection with this contract shall be the competent court in
            Vienna-Inner City, Austria.
          </p>
          <p>
            12.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Operator may modify these Terms of Service (and any
            policies or agreements referenced in these Terms of Service) at any
            time. We will post the most current version of these Terms of Service
            on each Service. We will provide you with reasonable notice of any
            change to the Terms of Service that, in our sole determination,
            materially adversely affect your rights or your use of the Service. We
            may provide you this notice via the Service and/or by email to the
            email address associated with your account. By continuing to use the
            Service after any revised Terms of Service become effective, you agree
            to be bound by the new Terms of Service.
          </p>
          <p>
            12.4&nbsp;&nbsp;Should individual provisions of this Contract be void,
            unenforceable and/or invalid, this shall not result in the invalidity,
            unenforceability and/or invalidity of the entire Contract. In this
            case, the contracting parties undertake to agree on a provision which
            is as close as possible economically to the purpose pursued by the
            void, unenforceable and/or invalid provision to replace the void,
            unenforceable and/or invalid provision.
          </p>
          <p>
            12.5&nbsp;&nbsp;Any non-English translations of these Terms of Service
            are provided for convenience only. The English version of these Terms
            of Service will control.
