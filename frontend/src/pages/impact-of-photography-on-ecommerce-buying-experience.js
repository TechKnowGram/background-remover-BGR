                  <h4>Ecommerce product Image as Consumer Perception- a study!</h4>
                  <p><strong>Premise:</strong> An image is a visual cue that customers' eyes are exposed to while they are looking for specific information. Numerous stimuli can be found in customers' surroundings, including textures, tastes, scents, and noises.</p>
                  <p>They might not always be able to see everything, though. Consumers can choose and select what to see and how to perceive it.</p>
                  <p>When it comes from their reliable favourite sources, many images or visual information might capture customers' attention immediately. However, the same piece of information may be questioned or even rejected by viewers if it comes from unreliable sources.</p>
                  <p>As everyone has a certain amount of time and capacity to comprehend such a large amount of inputs, this exemplifies the perceptual selection of consumers.</p>

                <p>Without the rich documents provided by these companies, it would not have been possible for us to create this study.
