            <p>If you are wondering what happens to your files when you upload them, the answer is simple: We upload them securely, process them as you would expect, provide you with the results for download, then delete them shortly after. That's all.</p>
            <p>We don't publish your files, we don't share them with anyone unexpected and we don't use them to improve our products, unless you explicitly send them to our team as feedback.</p>
            <p>We keep usage statistics (without your files) and if you contact us e.g. by email, we use the personal data you provide for our reply. If you buy from us, we also keep data for purposes like bookkeeping and financial reports.</p>
            <p>If you want to learn more, find our privacy policy below.</p>
